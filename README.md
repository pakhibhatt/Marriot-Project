For my last portfolio project with the Global Career Accelerator's Web Dev program, I worked with Publicis Sapient, a business management company.
They had a partnership with the program to allow students to experience what a professional company does in the Web Dev line of work. For the program, 
we were given a client, specifically Marriot Bonvoy, and were tasked to make some edits to make to the Marriot website to meet client needs. <br/><br/>

These tasks included making a pop-up to prompt a user for the area they would like to visit (city, beach, or mountains). Once the user answers that prompt,
the reccomendations on the home page should change to reflect the area they selected.<br/><br/>

Another task was to link the location a user selects to Google Maps to show where that location is. Once a user selects a location, the map will
automatically change to show the location of what the user entered.<br/><br/>

Technologies used:<br/>
--JavaScript --> use backend to display the popup find the stored location and connect the location to Google Maps<br/>
--HTML --> display the website and its recomendations with images and descriptions<br/>
--CSS --> styling for location cards and images<br/><br/>
