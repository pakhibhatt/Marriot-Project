It wouldn't let me type in the original document, so I created this one.

These websites are relevant because they all provide a service that allows 
users to book whole home rentals, which is similar to Marriot's mission to
provide homes and villas for vacation. 

Product features:
user is able to search for a specific location
user is able to filter results with specific features
user is able to adjust dates by adding a flexibility factor 
user has easy access to the homeowner for any questions (VRBO and BluePillow even as AI to ask questions)
user is able to adjust the map to view housing options in larger or smaller ranges
user is able to save the houses they like by adding them to favorites
user is able to view similar living spaces and compare values easily
user is able to easily view amenities provided with the living space
user is able to easily access reviews 
user is able to adjust booking details on the reservation page 


Short paragraph:

The user research suggests that a majority of users are unsure of location. Some may have an idea of what to 
do or what they would ideally like to do, but most of them don't know where to go. A common theme is that the 
website is relatively vague and hard to pinpoint a location based on the local activities. I think the users 
would like to have an experience where they are able to narrow their search and get an idea of where they would 
like to go.
